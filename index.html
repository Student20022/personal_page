                <h2>"Junior Software Engineer"</h2>
                <p>
                    As an aspiring Software Engineer, I am committed 
                    to learning how to write high-quality code that meets 
                    the modern standards of the programming field. 
                    I am currently studying at the University of Customs and 
                    Finance (UMSF), where I am focusing on Python and its 
                    frameworks, including Django and Flask. 
                    My goal is to deepen my understanding of these tools and 
                    apply them effectively in real-world projects.
